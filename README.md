# udacity-AI-DL-character-level-RNN
Python application generating TV Scripts using a RNN trained on "Seinfeld" which was a popular comedy show.

## purpose
Building a Python RNN neural network for natural language processing within Udacity nanodegree program 'Deep Learning'. After having trained the model 
the user can type in the name of a character and the network will generate a script.
